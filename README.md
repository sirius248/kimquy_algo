# KimquyAlgo

I created a simple ruby gem for sorting algorithms:
+ insertion sort
+ merge sort (this one still buggy need to be fixed)
+ quick sort
+ bubble sort
+ selection sort
+ heap sort
+ and more ...

## Example

array = [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] <br/>
array.quicksort -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] <br/>

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'kimquy_algo'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kimquy_algo
